# zotpick-applescript

Leverage [Better-BibTeX's citation picker](https://zotplus.github.io/better-bibtex/cayw.html) in Scrivener

These three scripts allow you to use [Better BibTeX's citation picker](https://zotplus.github.io/better-bibtex/cayw.html) 
with Scrivener. The three applets (available compiled in the Releases section) correspond 
to the three available citation ouputs: pandoc formatted citations, MultiMarkdown 
formatted citations, and Scannable Cites 
(for [RTF/ODF Scan for Zotero](http://zotero-odf-scan.github.io/zotero-odf-scan/)).

To use, set one of the applets as your refernce manager in Scrivener, call up with âŒ˜-Y 
and search for a citation in the box. Suffixes, prefixes, page numbers and author 
suppression can be set by clicking the selected citation in the search box and filling 
out the options. These do not work in MultiMarkdown output.

These applets work well in conjunction with this workflow for using [Scrivner, Pandoc, Zotero and Marked 2 for academic writing](https://github.com/davepwsmith/academic-scrivener-howto/).

**N.B** **These applets will type over whatever text you have selected when you call them. You have been warned.**
